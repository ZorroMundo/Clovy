# Clovy
This is an unfinished W.I.P GameMaker decompiler meant to serve as an alternative to DogScepter and UndertaleModTool.

As of the current state, it CAN NOT replace in any way, shape or form DogScepter or UndertaleModTool.
Clovy is still in a very experimental state, and it CAN NOT load any GameMaker games succesfully yet.

## Any contributions to this project would be greatly appreciated!
